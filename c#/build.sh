echo ERROR cannot build from command line. Thing is, if you build it from Intellij Rider in Release Mode, it produces twice better results than I could build with csc.exe from command line, because it goes through msbuild and it adds lots of keys, which I'm unable to analyze due to lack of need. Also project file is needed for that.
